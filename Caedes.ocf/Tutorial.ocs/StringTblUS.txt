Welcome1=Welcome to the round-based team shooter Caedes.
Welcome2=We want to get you right into the game - usually you would start by buying some stuff after you spawn.
Welcome3=Go to your flag, hit E and buy some stuff (at least 3 items)!
WelcomeEnd=Good job, now we really get started with some practice.
WelcomeInfo=Go to your flag and open the shop with E. Purchase stuff.

Pistol1=Let us get it on. Go into the shop and purchase a pistol {{Pistol_Title}}.
Pistol2=Good. We got for you the finest practice targets ready and in the air. Go shoot them up.
Pistol3=You probably noticed that they suddenly appear. In Caedes you only see enemies that are in your line of sight - that means: not blocked by material.
Pistol4=You can always reload with R and if you run out of ammo, you can purchase a new magazine in the shop by either clicking on the pistol or on \"Reload Weapons\" {{Symbol_ReloadWeapons}}, which will reload all weapons.
PistolEnd=Okay, let's get bigger weapons out.
PistolInfo=Go to your flag, open the shop with E, buy a pistol and shoot the targets. Reload with R and buy new ammo in the shop.

Shotgun1=Now the shotgun. You know the drill. Buy a shotgun {{Shotgun_Title}}!
Shotgun2=Kill the targets! The shotgun is deadly only at close range.
Shotgun3=You might find it easier to hit targets with the \"Accuracy\" {{Perk_Accuracy}} perk, that you can select in the shop.
Shotgun4=Perks are special skills that you can select for free. Select one that fits to your play style.
ShotgunEnd=Okay, one more fire weapon.
ShotgunInfo=Buy a shotgun (flag, E) and kill targets. Perks are special skills that you can select for free in the shop.

Sniper1=Buy a rifle {{Rifle_Title}}!
Sniper2=The rifle has a very long range but needs some time to aim. Try to hit the targets.
Sniper3=Some targets wear helmets. The helmet can protect you from exactly one deadly shot or explosion.
SniperEnd=Okay, now a more unconventional weapon.
SniperInfo=Buy a rifle. Shoot the targets. A helmet protects you from exactly one deadly shot.

MGL1=Now the same with a grenade launcher - the MGL {{GrenadeThrower_Title}}! Also get a bunch of cameras {{Camera_Title}}!
MGL2=Cameras are used to monitor areas - place them by throwing. Enemies can spot the cameras and defuse them.
MGL3=The MGL is a dangerous weapon - likely to hurt yourself and your team. Aim carefully.
MGL4=The grenades explode only after bouncing off a wall. So aim around corners!
MGLEnd=Now to something more explosive.
MGLInfo=Buy a MGL and cameras. Place cameras by throwing. Shoot targets. Ricochet grenades off walls.

Nades1=Go, buy some C4 {{C4_Title}} and some iron bombs {{IronBomb_Title}}!
Nades2=Both can hurt you too, don't forget to throw the iron bomb away after fusing and to keep distance to your C4.
Nades3=Throw the C4 and fuse it with the detonator you get. It deals more damage the closer the enemy is to the center.
Nades4=Try to blow up some targets. Hitting them will probably not be too easy.
NadesEnd=That was some fireworks. Well done. I believe we need bigger bombs.
NadesInfo=Buy iron bombs and C4. Be careful and blow up targets.

BigBomb1=The big bomb {{BigBomb}} is used in the goal \"Destruction\", where one team wants to place a bomb while the other one wants to prevent that.
BigBomb2=Collect the big bomb from your flag and carry it to the bomb zone.
BigBomb3=When you stand in front of the big, red X, you can hit Space to start planting the bomb.
BigBomb4=You can still use your weapons while planting the bomb. But you are vulnerable due to the lower view range.
BigBomb5=Good job. I will shorten the count down a bit for you. Don't stand in front of the bomb now!
BigBomb6=Someone from the enemy team could try to defuse the bomb by standing in front of it and pressing Space.
BigBombEnd=Well, I don't think the booms get bigger than that.
BigBombInfo=Get the big bomb from your flag. Stand in front of the bomb zone. Hit the Space-bar and plant the bomb.

FalconPunch1=Now for some general information. Check out the chat menu on Q.
FalconPunch2=It allows fast communication with your team.
FalconPunch3=Something else: Sometimes it happens that you run out of ammo and do not have enough money to buy more.
FalconPunch4=At times like this, you should try out your close combat attack on T.
FalconPunch5=It does a lot of damage but it is hard to hit. And you cannot stop it. Kill the two targets.
FalconPunchInfo=Try the chat menu on Q. Try the attack on T and kill targets.
FalconPunchEnd=Okay, that's the basics.

Epilogue1=This was not everything there is in Caedes, but it was a good start. The rest is for you to discover. Good luck!
EpilogueInfo=Good job, well done!
